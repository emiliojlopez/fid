				<h1>Our Core Values</h1>
				<ol>
					<li>WE PRAY FIRST</li>
					<p>Our relationship with God is #1. As we seek the face of God, we touch heaven, change earth, and invite His presence to come so that people who come to His house can connect with Him. We believe prayer is the foundation of everything we do at City Church and in our daily lives. <br>The first thing I want you to do is pray. Pray every way you know how, for everyone you know. Pray especially for rulers and their governments to rule well so we can be quietly about our business of living simply, in humble contemplation. This is the way our Savior God wants us to live. (1 Timothy 2:1-3 MSG)</p>
					<li>THE BIBLE IS OUR AUTHORITY</li>
					<p>The Bible is the supreme source of truth and our sole authority for Christian beliefs and living. We believe anointed teaching and preaching of the Word is the catalyst for life change. We honor Scripture in all we do, and we teach it in practical, relevant ways. <br>All Scripture is God-breathed, and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)</p>
					<li>EVERYONE IS WELCOME</li>
					<p>We are a church that says “Welcome Home” to every man, woman, and child who walks through the doors, regardless of age, race, or walk of life. We believe everyone matters to God, so they matter to us, and we will treat them like family. <br>Now that I’ve put you there on a hilltop, on a light stand – shine! Keep open house; be generous with your lives. By opening up to others, you’ll prompt people to open up with God, this generous Father in heaven. (Matthew 5:16 MSG)</p>
					<li>WE TAKE OUR NEXT STEPS</li>
					<p>Healthy and growing people change. We believe that people, regardless of where they are on their spiritual journey, are being transformed by Christ. As fully devoted followers of Christ, we are called to grow strong in Christ and keep moving forward.<br>This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God’s Son that we will be mature in the lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. (Ephesians 4:13 NLT)</p>
					<li>WE ARE BETTER TOGETHER</li>
					<p>We believe life change happens through relationships, and we grow best when we are in community. We connect, care, and grow through Small Groups. Joining a Small Group is the next step in living life in community and building friendships.<br>Day by day they continued with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved. (Acts 2:46-48)</p>
					<li>WE EQUIP EVERYONE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE</li>
					<p>We believe everyone is called and designed to make a difference in the world. Serving is the pathway to real significance and a meaningful life. The local church is the place God designed for us to discover, develop, and use our gifts.<br>Their responsibility is to equip God’s people to do His work and build up the church, the body of Christ. (Ephesians 4:12)</p>
					<li>WE REACH THOSE WHO ARE FAR FROM GOD</li>
					<p>We believe lost people matter to God, and therefore they matter to us. Our welcome mat reaches into the community and the world. We invite our friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, and even strangers to church. And we invite the community to our campus for Big Days so all can hear about Jesus Christ.<br>Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone. (Mark 16:15)</p>
					<li>WE LIVE TO GIVE</li>
					<p>We believe it is more blessed to give than receive. We are blessed to be a blessing, and to invest in the advancement of God’s kingdom. We will lead the way as a church and as individuals with crazy, radical, faith-inspired, Holy Spirit generosity!<br>Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in My House.  Test me in this and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it. (Malachi 3:10)</p>
					<li>WE RAISE UP THE NEXT GENERATION</li>
					<p>We intentionally pass on God’s truth to the younger generation in a relevant, appealing way. We are called to raise, equip, and empower young anointed leaders to serve God and influence culture in all walks of life, locally and globally. Generations who work together bring out the best in everyone.<br>We will not hide these truths from our children but will tell the next generation about the glorious deeds of the Lord. (Psalm 78:4)</p>
					<li>WE BELIEVE EXCELLENCE HONORS GOD AND INSPIRES PEOPLE</li>
					<p>We strive to provide compelling worship gatherings to inspire people and attract them to God’s house. We believe that exceeding the expectations of those we serve and continually making improvements springs out of a love for people. We want the House of God to be so irresistible that people can’t wait to come.<br>In the last days, the mountain of the Lord’s House will be the highest of all – the most important place on earth. It will be raised above the other hills, and people from all over the world will stream there to worship. People from many nations will come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of our God. There He will teach us His ways, and we will walk in His paths. (Isaiah 2:2-3 NLT)</p>
